All of the following .hex files are written in the raw LC-3 Assembly hex files to do each of the tasks:
- hwAdd3Mem: Will add the first 3 numbers after the halt
- hwAdd2Sub2Mem: Will add two numbers and then subtract the next two numbers stored in the memory after the halt 
- hwBigSmall: Gets User input of 2 characters & prints out the biggest ASCII value followed by the smaller
- hwPrintN-1: A simple loop program that loops n times & prints out the numbers decending

The following .asm files are written in Assembly language, then compiled to get the raw hex files:
